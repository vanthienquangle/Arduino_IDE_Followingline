# Arduino_IDE_Followingline
# The Robot is designed to follow the line with the functionality of two sensors 
# The pins were chosen on how we connect the wire with the Arduino Board
# Robot has four main functions : forward(), turnRight(), turnLeft(), and stop()
# Let's call the left sensor is L and right sensor is R.
# When the sensors detect the corresponding surface: L(black) & R(white) : turn left, L(white) & R(black): turn right, L(white) & R(white): go forward, L(black) & R(black): stop.
